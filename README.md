My name is Nolan, and I'm a Notre Dame CS grad currently working as a Software Engineer and Consultant at Pariveda in Chicago.

I'm passionate about creating human-centered software and pursuing excellence through four main skills:

1) Deep technical knowledge
2) An eye for design
3) Business understanding
4) Collaboration
