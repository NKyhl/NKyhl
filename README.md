## Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nolan, and I'm a senior at Notre Dame studying Computer Science.

I like to create human-centered software and pursue these skills:

1) Deep technical knowledge
2) An eye for design
3) Business understanding
4) Great collaboration skills

Reach out if you'd like to work on a project together! (nolan@kyhl.com)
