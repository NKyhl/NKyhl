My name is Nolan, and Notre Dame Computer Science alum working as a Consultant at Pariveda in Chicago.

I'm passionate about creating human-centered software and pursuing excellence through four main skills:

1) Deep technical knowledge
2) An eye for design
3) Business understanding
4) Great collaboration skills
